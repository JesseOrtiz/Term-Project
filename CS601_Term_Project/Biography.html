        <strong>
            <h2 class="h2">Early Life and Education:</h2>
        </strong>
    
        <h5 class = "h5">I was born in Lancaster, California, and grew up in 
            Palmdale, ca. After completing my high school education at Palmdale High School, 
            I decided to pursue further studies at Antelope Valley College. 
            There, I enrolled in the Airframe Manufacturing Technology program and successfully 
            completed my Bachelor of Science degree in 2021. Additionally, I obtained a Certificate 
            in Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly.
        </h5>

        <strong>
            <h2 class="h2">Career in Aerospace:</h2>
        </strong>
    
        <h5 class = "h5">Following my education, I began my career in the aerospace field 
            as an Aircraft Mechanic at Northrop Grumman in Palmdale, California. From 2019 
            to 2022, I gained valuable experience working on various aspects of aircraft 
            maintenance and repair, including structures, composites, electrical systems, 
            and hydraulic systems. I honed my skills in blueprint reading, fabrication 
            techniques, and the installation of components. I transitioned into the role 
            of Associate Manufacturing Systems Engineer at Northrop Grumman in early 2022. 
            In this position, I have been involved in leveraging augmented reality (AR) 
            technology to enhance manufacturing processes. 
        </h5>

        <strong>
            <h2 class="h2">Future Goals:</h2>
        </strong>
    
        <h5 class = "h5">In pursuit of further professional growth and to expand my 
            knowledge in the field of technology, I am currently pursuing a Master of 
            Science degree in Software Development at Boston University. This program 
            aligns with my passion for leveraging technology to drive 
            innovation and optimize processes in the aerospace industry. By combining 
            my expertise in manufacturing technology with software development skills, 
            I aim to contribute to the advancement of aerospace manufacturing practices 
            and stay at the forefront of the industry.
